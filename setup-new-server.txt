# execute reboot

after reboot, check ip on admin port (port1):

# show system interface ?

on cli execute this commands (just use cut/paste)

        set wanoptgrp read-write
        set endpoint-control-grp read-write
        set wifi read-write

when done, 

# execute reboot

2. Snapshut and create new image.

cfy blueprints upload -b FG -p FortigateFirewall.yaml
cfy deployments create -b FG -d FG -i FortigateFirewall-input.yaml
cfy executions start -d FG -w install -l
